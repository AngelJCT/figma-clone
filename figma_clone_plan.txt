Plan for Building a Simplified Figma Clone for Multi-Device Web Design Phase 1: Project Setup & Architecture 1.1 Technology Stack Decision Frontend Framework: Next JS Canvas Rendering: HTML5 Canvas API or Fabric.js for easier object manipulation State Management: Zustand or Redux for managing canvas state Styling: Tailwind CSS for UI components Build Tool: Vite for fast development 1.2 Project Structure /src /components /Canvas /Toolbar /Sidebar /Templates /store /utils /types /constants 1.3 Core Data Models Define TypeScript interfaces for: Canvas element (position, size, type, properties) Template (name, dimensions, device type) Layer hierarchy Project state Phase 2: Canvas Foundation 2.1 Canvas Implementation Create main canvas component with pan and zoom capabilities Implement viewport transformation (translate, scale) Add infinite canvas feel with grid background Handle mouse events (click, drag, scroll) 2.2 Element System Base element class/interface with common properties: Position (x, y) Dimensions (width, height) Rotation Opacity Z-index for layering Element rendering engine Selection system (single and multiple selection) 2.3 Transform Controls Resize handles (8-point bounding box) Rotation handle Drag to move functionality Snap to grid/guidelines Phase 3: Template System 3.1 Predefined Templates Create template presets: Desktop: 1920x1080, 1440x900, 1366x768 Tablet: 768x1024 (iPad), 834x1194 (iPad Pro) Mobile: 375x812 (iPhone X), 390x844 (iPhone 12), 360x800 (Android) 3.2 Template Selector Modal or sidebar with template cards Visual preview of each template "Create Custom Size" option Template categories/filters 3.3 Artboard Implementation Multiple artboards on single canvas Artboard boundaries and labels Background color per artboard Export individual artboards Phase 4: Essential Design Elements 4.1 Layout Components Container/Frame: Grouping element with padding Flexbox container: Row/column layout with gap, justify, align Grid container: Define columns, rows, and gaps Auto-layout properties (spacing, alignment) 4.2 Typography System Text element with properties: Font family (system fonts + Google Fonts integration) Font size, weight, line height Letter spacing, text alignment Color and opacity Rich text editing capabilities Text styles/presets (H1, H2, Body, etc.) 4.3 Shape Elements Rectangle (with border radius) Circle/Ellipse Line Basic properties: fill color, stroke, shadow 4.4 Image Support Upload images (drag-drop or file picker) Image element with crop/fit options Placeholder images for mockups Basic filters (grayscale, blur, brightness) Phase 5: Core Tools & Interactions 5.1 Toolbar Implementation Selection tool (V): Default cursor for selecting/moving Frame tool (F): Draw containers Text tool (T): Add text elements Shape tools (R): Rectangle, Circle Image tool (I): Place images Hand tool (H): Pan canvas 5.2 Properties Panel Context-sensitive panel showing selected element properties Quick access to: Position & size inputs Layout properties (flexbox/grid settings) Typography controls Color pickers Opacity slider 5.3 Layers Panel Hierarchical tree view of all elements Drag to reorder layers Toggle visibility Lock/unlock elements Group/ungroup functionality Phase 6: Responsive Design Features 6.1 Responsive Constraints Pin to edges (top, right, bottom, left) Fixed vs. fluid width/height Scale proportionally option 6.2 Device Preview Quick toggle between device sizes Preview how design adapts to different screens Side-by-side view option 6.3 Component Variants Create mobile/tablet/desktop variants of components Quick duplicate to other artboards Link variants for easy switching Phase 7: Essential Features 7.1 Undo/Redo System Command pattern implementation History stack (limit to last 50 actions) Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl + Z, Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Z) 7.2 Keyboard Shortcuts Selection: V Frame: F Text: T Shape: R Delete: Backspace/Delete Duplicate: Cmd/Ctrl + D Copy/Paste: Cmd/Ctrl + C/V Group: Cmd/Ctrl + G Zoom: Cmd/Ctrl + +/- 7.3 Alignment & Distribution Align left, center, right, top, middle, bottom Distribute horizontally/vertically Smart guides during drag 7.4 Copy/Paste & Duplicate Copy style properties Duplicate elements Clipboard handling Phase 8: Project Management 8.1 Save/Load System Local storage auto-save Export project as JSON Import project from JSON Project metadata (name, last modified) 8.2 Export Functionality Export artboards as PNG/JPG Export individual elements Export at different scales (1x, 2x, 3x) Export all artboards as ZIP Phase 9: Polish & Testing 9.1 UI/UX Refinement Dark/light theme Smooth animations Loading states Empty states with helpful guidance 9.2 Performance Optimization Canvas rendering optimization (only redraw changed areas) Debounce property updates Lazy loading for heavy operations Virtual scrolling for layers panel 9.3 Testing Test all tools and interactions Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) Responsive UI testing Edge cases (empty canvas, many elements, large images) 9.4 Documentation In-app tooltips Keyboard shortcut reference Quick start guide Template library showcase Additional Features for Future Iterations Color styles/design tokens Components library Collaboration (real-time editing) Version history Comments/annotations Plugin system More export formats (SVG, PDF) Asset library Prototyping links
